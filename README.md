# linux_config

mikbuch's configuration files for linux (arch and debian, as well as OS X).

On a daily basis I use xterm enhanced with tmux window manager.
My text editor is vim, however, recently I switched to atom with vim-mode-plus.
My primary shell is zsh (oh-my-zsh, https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

For file management I choose Double Commander (https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/).
My web browser is quetebrowser (https://qutebrowser.org/), alternatively firefox.
